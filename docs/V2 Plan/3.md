# 📘 **Adaptive Learning LMS – System Design Document**

### **Author:** Vidit Aggarwal

### **Project Type:** Adaptive Learning Management System (LMS)

### **Core Vision:**

> “Teach one concept at a time, in the simplest possible way, to the student who needs it most — based on data, not assumption.”

---

## 🧭 **1. Overview**

Traditional LMS platforms deliver static content without accounting for a learner’s pace, retention, or comprehension.
This project aims to build an **adaptive learning LMS** that continuously personalizes lessons, theory, and questions based on student understanding — creating a dynamic, evidence-driven learning path.

---

## 🧩 **2. System Architecture**

The LMS operates through **three interlinked intelligences**:

| Layer                       | Focus                                 | Output                                                     |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Curriculum Intelligence** | Define and structure learning content | Knowledge Map (Units → Chapters → Topics → Lessons → Tags) |
| **Diagnostic Intelligence** | Assess student learning and cognition | Student Learning Profile                                   |
| **Adaptive Intelligence**   | Personalize delivery and progression  | Question & Theory Recommendation Engine                    |

---

## 🧱 **3. Curriculum Intelligence**

### **3.1 Hierarchical Structure**

```
Unit → Chapter → Topic → Lesson → Tag
```

| Level       | Purpose                    | Key Data Points                                              |
| :---------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unit**    | Broad conceptual category  | Subject Area                                                 |
| **Chapter** | Logical grouping of topics | Domain, key outcomes                                         |
| **Topic**   | Concept subset             | Thematic focus                                               |
| **Lesson**  | Teachable module           | Learning outcome, difficulty level, skill emphasis           |
| **Tag**     | Micro-skill/concept node   | Concept tag, IB command term, skill type, dependency mapping |

Each **lesson** is a bundle of tags with:

- `learning_outcome`
- `difficulty_level (1–10)`
- `related_lessons` (dependencies)
- `tags` (micro-concepts and skills)

This creates a **Knowledge Graph** — the structural brain of the LMS.

## 🧠 **4. Diagnostic Intelligence**

### **4.1 Objective**

To measure how each student _learns_, _retains_, and _adapts_ — not just whether they answer correctly.

### **4.2 Core Diagnostic Pillars**

| Pillar                      | Purpose                          | Measurement                             | Outcome                             |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **Accuracy & Attempts**     | Measure conceptual understanding | % correct, retries                      | Determines comprehension depth      |
| **Speed / Time Efficiency** | Measure fluency                  | Avg time per question                   | Identifies confidence vs hesitation |
| **Retention**               | Measure long-term understanding  | Re-test after 7/14/30 days              | Detects concept decay               |
| **Stamina**                 | Measure endurance & focus        | Accuracy trend over time                | Detects fatigue or attention decay  |
| **Adaptability**            | Measure flexibility              | Performance on unseen/new-tag questions | Tests generalization and transfer   |
| **Engagement**              | Measure focus                    | Idle time, skip rate, hints used        | Detects attentional consistency     |

---

### **4.3 Student–Lesson Vector**

Each student’s performance on a lesson is stored as a **diagnostic vector**:

```json
{
  "lesson_id": "SL 5.4a",
  "accuracy": 0.72,
  "avg_time": 38,
  "attempts": 1.3,
  "difficulty_mastered": 7,
  "retention_score": 0.65,
  "stamina_drop": 0.18,
  "adaptability_index": 0.52
}
```

This allows both **individual** and **aggregate** analytics at the tag level.

---

### **4.4 Derived Cognitive Metrics**

| Metric                 | Definition                                  | Interpretation                    |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------- |
| **Retention Score**    | Re-test accuracy after 7/14/30 days         | >0.8 = strong memory, <0.5 = weak |
| **Stamina Drop**       | ΔAccuracy between first & last 10 questions | >0.2 = fatigue pattern            |
| **Adaptability Index** | Success on “new” questions                  | >0.6 = concept mastery            |
| **Focus Ratio**        | Active time / total time                    | Measures attention stability      |
| **Learning Velocity**  | Change in accuracy over time                | Rate of cognitive growth          |

---

### **4.5 Practical Example**

**Case:**
A student scores well early, then drops in performance after 30 minutes.

**System Interpretation:**

```
Lesson Mastery: 78%
Retention: Stable (0.82)
Stamina: Weak (-0.25 accuracy drop)
Adaptability: Low (0.38)
Recommendation:
  - Shorter sessions (20 mins)
  - Simplified concept variations
  - Add review after 48 hrs (spaced repetition)
```

The LMS thus becomes both **teacher** and **coach**.

## ⚙️ **5. Adaptive Intelligence**

### **5.1 Objective**

Deliver the _right question or theory snippet_ at the _right difficulty level_ — continuously refined through data.

---

### **5.2 Question Metadata Schema**

Each question stores metadata used for personalization:

| Field               | Description                          |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------- |
| `question_id`       | Unique question reference            |
| `tags[]`            | Concept tags it assesses             |
| `difficulty_level`  | 1–10 scale                           |
| `skill_type`        | Conceptual / Computational / Applied |
| `avg_success_rate`  | Global difficulty calibration        |
| `avg_time_expected` | Target fluency benchmark             |

---

### **5.3 Adaptive Logic (Two-Stage Algorithm)**

#### **Stage 1: Rule-Based (MVP)**

Weighted logic based on accuracy, time, and difficulty gap:

```
score = α*(1 - accuracy) + β*(1 - time_efficiency) + γ*(difficulty_gap)
```

- If `score > 0.6` → simplify content (reteach)
- If `0.4 ≤ score ≤ 0.6` → maintain same level
- If `score < 0.4` → increase challenge level

✅ Supports RYG scaling:

- 🔴 Red → Weak (reteach)
- 🟡 Yellow → Practice
- 🟢 Green → Advance

---

#### **Stage 2: Adaptive ML (Growth Phase)**

**Matrix Factorization Recommender:**

- **Inputs:** Student × Tag matrix (proficiency) + Question × Tag matrix (difficulty)
- **Goal:** Predict probability of success ( P\_{student,question} )

Select next question:

```
argmax(0.4 < P(success) < 0.8)
```

→ Always challenges, never overwhelms.

---

### **5.4 Data Points Tracked**

| Raw Metric        | Derived Insight     |
| :---------------- | :------------------ |
| Time per question | Fluency             |
| Attempts          | Confidence          |
| Hint usage        | Concept dependency  |
| Accuracy trend    | Mastery progression |
| Re-test score     | Retention stability |
| Performance decay | Stamina insight     |

---

### **5.5 Lesson Quality Factor**

The system also self-assesses its own lessons:

```
Lesson Quality = w₁*(avg_success_rate) + w₂*(engagement_ratio) + w₃*(retention_rate)
```

Low-quality lessons (low comprehension, long time, high retries) are flagged for review or rephrasing.

---

## 🧩 **6. Integrated Flow**

```
1️⃣ Curriculum Intelligence  →  defines structure
2️⃣ Diagnostic Intelligence  →  identifies learner profile
3️⃣ Adaptive Intelligence    →  delivers personalized pathway
```

Each lesson’s data improves both the **student model** and the **content model**.

---

## 🧩 **8. System Behavior Example**

**Scenario:**
Student “Riya” performs well in 5.1a (limits) but takes too long, and forgets in re-test.

**System Response:**

```
- Marks low retention (0.45)
- Recommends simpler theory snippet tagged “limit-visualization”
- Schedules spaced repetition after 72 hours
- Next question difficulty lowered from 6 → 5
- Lesson flagged for possible rephrasing
```

The system **learns the learner** — and **learns from the learner**.

---
